## Project Overview
This project aims to create a data pipeline using PySpark to integrate and analyze sales data from three different sources: product information, sales transactions, and customer details. The pipeline processes the data, cleans and transforms it, and answers a set of analytical questions to derive insights from the integrated dataset.

## Technologies Used
- **PySpark**: For data processing and analysis
- **Python**: Programming language used for the pipeline
- **CSV**: Data format for input datasets
